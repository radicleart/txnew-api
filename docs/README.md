# DAO and Crews

The goal is to explore how eDAO in its current form can be integrated with Bitcoin AIX Crews and Resource Contracts.

### Authorisation

Only where its useful for discussion the following convention can be used for marking authorisation levels for public Clarity methods.

For Clarity the conventions are;

\- everyone (anyone can do it)

\- asset owner (FT, NFT, etc)

\- dao deployer / contract owner

\- group access (assigned roles)

\- base-dao access (self)

\- extension access (self)

These are meant as a guide as they are checks implemented in business logic as opposed to structurally within Clarity but are used here just as a way to discuss authorisation concepts at the model level.

## Crew and Resource Management

Following suggestion shows flow using resource contracts controlling a 402 payment flow with Crews (collections of human or AI agents) offering services.
